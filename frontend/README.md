# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

Create the environment file:

```
# Private
SECRET_KEY=my_secret_key


# Public
PUBLIC_API_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Company Name
```


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```
